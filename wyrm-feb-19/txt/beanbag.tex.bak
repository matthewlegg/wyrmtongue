The first thing I would like to put out there is that this Beanbagship
has not been at all what I expected. Our glorious Sofa this year was
somewhat expected (at least by me) to be a tyranncial overlord,
delegating tasks to me for the sake of it. Imagine my surprise when
not only has he done a simply spectacular job putting together this
year's Picocon, but I've also had to harass \emph{him} into giving me
tasks to do!

After scraping into the Beanbag position by accident in much the same
way Ed did last year, I really wasn't sure what to expect, and as I
write this I fear the worst (in terms of stress and amount of work) is
certainly yet to come. The reassuring \textemdash{} if
shocking \textemdash{} fact, though, is that I cannot think of a
single person I'd rather have been working as the Sofa this
year. Don't tell him I said that \ldots

Of course, I must also send a huge thank you to everyone who is
volunteering to assist us on this magnificent day. No matter how far
away you come from \textemdash{} whether that is Corellia, Runeterra,
or even (shudders) UCL \ldots Welcome all to our
most \emph{Intriguing} Picocon yet!
