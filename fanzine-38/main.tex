Good afternoon everyone.

Picocon 38 \emph{Automata} is largely acorporeal, and so
this might be the first time in a while that the \emph{Picocon Fanzine} isn't a
physical object. This hasn't stopped our friends in the Imperial College
Science Fiction \& Fantasy Society from bringing forth some excellent pieces of
artwork and writing. This year: a detective story, an autobiography; an old
tale in a new voice, a new tale in an old one\textemdash and also: statistics.

As always: thanks so much to everyone who wrote to us in these past few
months, to everyone with us at Picocon today, and to all of you reading in the
future.
